<!-- ## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ -->

<!-- I'm Jerry, a Master's student in Computer Science Engineering at the University of Michigan, where I also work as a Graduate Student Instructor, sharing my love for coding and problem-solving with others. My academic journey blends technical depth and human-centered thinking, with a double Bachelor's in Computer Science and Psychology.

Iâ€™ve tackled challenges ranging from crafting OS-level thread libraries to building user-friendly full-stack web applications, leveraging tools like React, Python, and AWS. My passion for innovation extends to research, where Iâ€™ve enhanced surgeonsâ€™ training with interactive visualizations, and to internships at Intel and startups, where Iâ€™ve honed my skills in software engineering and scalable system design.

Beyond code, I thrive in teaching, mentoring, and working in collaborative, cross-functional teams. I'm currently exploring full-time roles in software development, AI/ML, UI/UX, or technical project management, eager to create impactful solutions. Let's connect and build something amazing together! ðŸš€ -->
